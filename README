This package allows you to interact with the Systemd Notification
daemon.

It is meant to provide feedback to Systemd about the runtime status
of a service.

A service periodically sends watchdog (heartbeat) events to
Systemd's notification daemon. When the watchdog (heartbeat) events
stop, Systemd knows the service has a problem and can restart it.

Three classes are provided to interact with the notification service.

Notify is the general purpose implementation.
NotifyHeartbeat is ideal for applications that only send heartbeats
NotifyFluent has the same methods as Notify but all the setters are
fluent.

See the test-service.php, and test-service.service for examples
